Simple Linear Regression Study
This repository contains code for a simple linear regression model to explore the relationship between two variables.

Description
This project implements a simple linear regression model to understand the linear relationship between two features. It utilizes libraries like Scikit-learn for Python to perform data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python (version 3.x recommended)
Scikit-learn library (pip install scikit-learn)
(Optional) Additional data analysis libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib) for further exploration
Running the Model
Clone this repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository directory.
Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt (if a requirements.txt file is provided).
Run the main script (e.g., python main.py).
The script should load data, train the model, and potentially generate outputs like predictions or visualizations.

Project Structure
This repository may include the following folders and files (adapt based on your actual structure):

data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
src: Houses the Python script(s) for model implementation.
output: Stores generated outputs, such as predictions or plots (optional).
requirements.txt: Lists required Python libraries (optional).
Additional Notes
This is a basic template. You can modify it to include specific details about your project, data source, and evaluation metrics.
Consider adding comments and docstrings to your code for better readability.
Feel free to extend the project with techniques like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using metrics like R-squared and mean squared error.
